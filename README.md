Reusable GitGub Actions for Antribute Workflows

## Local Testing

GitHub provides no official way to test GitHub actions locally. Luckily, an open source CLI app
called [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act) allows us to run our workflows locally. To install Act,
simply run `brew install act`. Other installation instructions can be found in their official
documentation.
